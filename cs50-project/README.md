    Runnify is a web application that enables users to publish and execute errands.

    Upon opening the website, the users are prompted to Log In or Register. 

    In the navigation bar, there are four options to click on. 

    1. 'Profile' - This contains the user's username, points, profile picture, errands in progress, and errands published. Users can upload an image file to their profile to use it as a profile picture to be associated with their errand requests. Any errand requests that the user has written will be displayed on the profile as well. The profile page has a link, 'Click to View Errands in Progress', which, when clicked, will display any active errands that the user has chosen to undertake. 

    2. 'Publish' - This opens a page where a user can write an errand request that will be added to the Feed, located on the 'Home' page. Users must write a title for their errand, a brief description, a time limit (in minutes), and must use the drag/drop indicator on the map to provide a location where their errand will take place. Then, click the submit button to add the errand to the feed. 

    3. 'Home' - All users' errand requests will be posted in chronological order on the Home page. Clicking the button 'Find Errands Near Me' will generate an alternate display of the posted requests, where the requests with the closest distances are pushed to the top of the page and arranged in ascending order of distance. The user can scroll through the errand requests in the feed, and when they find an errand that they can complete, they can click on it to be taken to the 'Errand_detail' page. 

        3a. 'Errand_detail' - Clicking on an errand in the feed will open a page showing the title of the errand, the errand's description, the errand's author's username, the location of the errand, the time when it was published, and an 'Execute' button. Clicking on this button will allow the user to execute this errand, taking the user to the 'execute_errand' page. 

            3i. 'Execute_errand' - When the button 'execute' is pressed, the timer set by the errand's publisher will begin. The user must complete the errand within the timer's length for the execution to be valid. The user also has the option to 'Opt-out' of the errand by clicking on the 'Opt-Out' button. When the errand's publisher has determined the errand to be executed, they can open their errand from their profile and click the 'executed' button to mark it as completed. 

    4. 'Log Out' - Clicking on this option will log the user out and send them back to the log-in page. 

    Additional Mechanism: 
    Points - Publishing a request costs 5 points. A user can earn 5 points by completing errand requests, and will gain 20 points after completing their profile and logging in.
